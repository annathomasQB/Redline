# Redline
POC for Content Listing


This is the Readme for the POC created

No external libraries were used for this Project. 

The requirements stated were achieved. 

Major challenge while building the POC was in making the UI work correctly for the Navigation bar image. It works differently for iPhone X and above. So trying to find out a common solution for this took the majority of time to solve.

KNOWN ISSUES : The navigation title and images appear to be beneath the navigation image. Probably a different image or more work on the code can solve this issue. 

Please note that the search button though added, is not implemented as it was not mentioned in the requirement. 

It was a good POC and glad to have spent time on it.
