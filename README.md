# Redline
POC for Content Listing


This is the Readme for the POC created

No external libraries were used for this Project. 

The requirements stated were achieved. 

Major challenge while building the POC was in making the UI work correctly for the Navigation bar image. It works differently for iPhone X and above. So trying to find out a common solution for this took a majority of time to solve.

Please note that the search button though added, is not implemented as it was not mentioned in the requirement. 

It was a good POC and glad to have spent time on it.
